# jason-metadata-ss-to-json
Reformat and augment Jason cruise metadata to JSON format from spreadsheet.
Jason cruise metadata has historically been captured in a multi worksheet
spreadsheet. This is an awkward product for migrating a data package to the
MGDS national data archive. This project then seeks to convert spreadsheet
content to a name-value collection (JSON format was agreed), with expectation
that such a format will more readily support scripting.
